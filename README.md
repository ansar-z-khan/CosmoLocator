App being used to detect Cosmic Rays on an iPhone

This app is desinged to use the CCD on iPhones, to pick up instances of Cosmic Rays striking the phone and reporting them.

The image of the incidence along with other meta-data is stored on a google firebase server.

Update: Jan 5, 2018: This project has been delayed due the revival of @Shermanator1512 's Success tracker, as I have decided to dedicate my time on that. This will continue in the beginning of semester two
